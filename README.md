#Dynare Project in Python

This is project in progress. The idea is to try and develop a program similar to MATLAB Dynare but written in Python.

Important features:

- Thanks to the sympy library we can know optimize and solve the problem directly through Python

We are working preliminary with a simple neoclassical RBC model, but in the future we hope to work with any other model.

The goals for this project are:

1. Optimize and solve the neoclassical model
2. compute the stationary states
3. simulate a exogenous shock to the model and its correspondent Impulse and response.
4. Basically, recreate MATLAB but in Python.
